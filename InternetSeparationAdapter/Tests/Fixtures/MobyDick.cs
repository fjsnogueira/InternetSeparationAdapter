      @"Call me Ishmael. Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--havin little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me o shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part o the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulatin the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I fin myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing u the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos ge such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle t prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodicall knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to se as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With  philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietl take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but kne it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish ver nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round b wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it wit her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extrem downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, an cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land Look at the crowds of water-gazers there

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlear Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. Wha do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stan thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Som leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; som looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in th rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But thes are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster--tied t counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Ar the green fields gone? What do they here

But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, an seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but th extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonde warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the wate as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand--miles o them--leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, street and avenues--north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of al those ships attract them thither

Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Tak almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in  dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magi in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepes reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he wil infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try thi experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysica professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded fo ever

But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley o the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; an here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonde cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds  mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in thei hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and thoug this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd' head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon th magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for score on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is th one charm wanting?--Water--there is not a drop of water there! Wer Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles t see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving tw handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadl needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Wh is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, a some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as  passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when firs told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did th old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separat deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who becaus he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves se in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom o life; and this is the key to it all

Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begi to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse i but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers ge sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don't sleep of nights--do not enjo themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a passenger nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as  Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinctio of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate al honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kin whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not And as for going as cook,--though I confess there is considerable glor in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board--yet, somehow I never fancied broiling fowls;--though once broiled, judiciousl buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one wh will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broile fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the ol Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see th mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids

No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar t spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sor of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's sense of honour particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, th Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have bee lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stan in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from  schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca an the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off i time

What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broo and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archange Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly an respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain' a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains ma order me about--however they may thump and punch me about, I have th satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else i one way or other served in much the same way--either in a physica or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump i passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, an be content

Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point o paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a singl penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves mus pay. And there is all the difference in the world between payin and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortabl infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But BEIN PAID,--what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a ma receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestl believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no accoun can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselve to perdition

Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesom exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part th Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand fro the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but no so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in man other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as  merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whalin voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has th constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences m in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than any one else. And doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the gran programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in a a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this “GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES

“WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL

“BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN. Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, th Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when other were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short an easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces--thoug I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all th circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motive which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induce me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into th delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewil and discriminating judgment

Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the grea whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all m curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his islan bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with al the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helpe to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would no have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlastin itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land o barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive  horror, and could still be social with it--would they let me--since i is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the plac one lodges in

By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; th great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wil conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated int my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of the all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air
